## Energy Conservation Testing

### Motivation

Climate models explicitly encode the known laws of physics, known in the atmosphere as "the primitive equations", which include the First Law of Thermodynamics. Applied to the Earth, the First Law states that the rate of change of energy in the Earth system is equal to the rate of incoming energy minus the rate of outgoing energy. This is formulated mathematically below, where $E$ is energy, $t$ is time, $I$ is incoming, and $O$ is outgoing. [citation needed]

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = I - O
$$

$E$ refers to all planetary energy, which is too broad for our ambitions. Climate models are primarily concerned with the atmosphere (I may get beat up for this base and baseless claim), and so they are built to conserve *atmospheric* energy. The atmosphere is not alone, however; its neighbors (solid Earth and space) often interact with it. Oceans exchange energy with the atmosphere at their boundary, volcanoes erupt and release hot greenhouse gases which directly and indirectly warm the atmosphere, and whether you want to call them comets or asteroids, rocks larger than Mt. Everest collide with the Earth now and then (Desch et al. 2021)[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2105.08768]. 

Ocean-atmosphere interactions, volcanism, and asteroid impacts have one thing in common: during the average six hour period on Earth, none of them has a major impact on the total energy of the atmosphere. In fact, adding up all non-solar energy fluxes into the atmosphere accounts for less than 1/2600th of the average amount of energy the atmosphere receives in one second [Table 2, Kren et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1051/swsc/2017007). 

### Experimental Design

1. Calculate Earth's effective radiative temperature ($T_e$) given Earth's mean outgoing longwave radiation ($\overline{OLR}$): $T_e = (\overline{OLR}/\sigma)^{1/4} $
$$
\frac{\partial E_T}{\partial t} = \overline{ISR} - \overline{OLR} \to \boxed{\overline{OLR} = \overline{ISR} - \frac{\partial E_T}{\partial t}}
$$

$$
T_e = (\overline{OLR}/\sigma)^{1/4} =
