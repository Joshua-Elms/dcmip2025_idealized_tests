Welcome to the ML working group at DCMIP 2025!

This repository contains all necessary code for the workshop. 

These tests produce a lot of data -- possibly on the order of hundreds of gigabytes of netcdf files, depending on your configuration.

Your $HOME directory on NCAR's HPC systems has limited storage space, so you will probably run out of space if you try to store the data there. 

This script will create data directories throughout the repository and symlink them to a high-capacity storage system of your choice, such as $WORK or $SCRATCH.

$WORK has 2TB of storage space per user and no purge policy (your data will not be deleted unless you delete it yourself). 

$SCRATCH has 30TB of storage space per user, but it is purged if you do not access your data for 180 days. 

For more details, see https://ncar-hpc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storage-systems/.

Where would you like to store the data?
